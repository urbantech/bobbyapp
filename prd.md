- Offer **dynamic personality shifts**, where characters evolve based on user interactions and relationships.
- Ensure **privacy-first AI interactions** using local LLMs like Ollama, preventing data leaks.

## **3. Core Features & Functional Requirements**
### **3.1 AI Character System**
- **Character Creation & Personality Customization**  
  - Users can define AI characters with a name, personality traits, backstory, and role.
  - Character emotions and moods dynamically shift based on interactions.
  - Profiles stored in **Supabase/PostgreSQL JSONB format**.

- **Conversational AI & Contextual Memory**  
  - AI retains long-term memory using **vector storage (Pinecone/Supabase)**.
  - Uses **reinforcement learning** to improve in-character responses.
  - Hardcoded responses for avoiding fourth-wall breaks.

- **Multi-Character Conversations**  
  - AI-to-AI dialogue (characters speak to each other).
  - Conversational flow based on character personality & event triggers.
  - Turn-based or free-flowing roleplay modes.

### **3.2 RPG Mechanics**
- **Character Stats System**  
  - Attributes (Strength, Intelligence, Dexterity, Charisma, etc.).
  - Leveling up through quests and interactions.
  - Health, mana, and special ability meters.

- **Dice Roll Mechanics (D20 System, D6, etc.)**  
  - AI and players can roll dice for combat, persuasion, exploration.
  - Success determined by character stats + dice roll.

- **Quest Generation & Branching Storylines**  
  - AI dynamically generates quests based on user interactions.
  - Users can make choices that alter the story.
  - AI tracks player progress and adapts dialogue accordingly.

- **Inventory & Items Management**  
  - Players and AI can acquire weapons, potions, artifacts.
  - Items affect interactions (e.g., a magic amulet increases persuasion success).

### **3.3 Multimodal AI Enhancements**
- **Voice Support**  
  - AI characters **speak** using **Coqui TTS**.
  - Users can **talk to AI characters via speech-to-text** (Whisper AI).

- **AI-Generated Character Avatars**  
  - Stable Diffusion creates unique AI portraits.
  - Dynamic avatars based on emotions (angry, happy, sad, etc.).

- **Animated Expressions & Actions**  
  - Lottie/Rive animations for **character emotions**.
  - Character visuals react to dice rolls (e.g., sad face on critical failure).

### **3.4 Multiplayer & Interactive Features**
- **Multiplayer Mode (Future Feature)**  
  - Users can roleplay with AI and other human players.
  - Shared storylines with AI-driven NPCs.

- **AI-Powered NPCs & Factions**  
  - AI characters belong to different factions, affecting interactions.
  - AI can **form opinions** about players based on past choices.

## **4. Technical Architecture**
### **4.1 System Flow**
1. **User interacts with AI character** â†’ API sends prompt with character profile.
2. **Ollama LLM generates response** based on fine-tuned data.
3. **Vector storage retrieves relevant memory** to ensure continuity.
4. **RPG mechanics process interactions** (e.g., dice roll calculations, quest progression).
5. **Multimodal AI generates voice output and character animations**.
6. **Response is returned to frontend** in text, voice, and image format.

### **4.2 Backend & APIs**
| **Service** | **Technology** |
|------------|---------------|
| Character Management | FastAPI (Python), PostgreSQL |
| AI Model & Conversations | Ollama (Mistral/LLaMA fine-tuned), LangChain |
| Memory Storage | Pinecone / Supabase Vector DB |
| RPG Mechanics | Python (Dice Rolls, Inventory, Stats) |
| Speech Processing | Whisper AI (Speech-to-Text), Coqui TTS (Text-to-Speech) |
| Image Generation | Stable Diffusion API |

### **4.3 Frontend Features**

|------------|---------------|
| Chat Interface | Next.js, React |
| Character Customization | Tailwind CSS, Lottie Animations |
| AI Voice Playback | Web Audio API |
| Image Rendering | Canvas API / Stable Diffusion |

## **5. Monetization Strategy**
- **Freemium Model**: Basic AI chat is free; advanced AI memory & multimodal features require subscription.
- **Custom AI Training**: Users can pay to train personalized AI.
- **Marketplace**: Users buy/sell custom AI characters, storylines, and assets.
- **API Access for Developers**: Offer an API subscription for embedding AI-powered NPCs into external games.

## **6. Security & Privacy**
